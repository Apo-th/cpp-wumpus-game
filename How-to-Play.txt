Silven Valley was a peaceful town,
before the wumpus came to 
terrorise it. The villagers have
rounded up their fortune to hire a
strong warrior to defeat the Wumpus.

The Wumpus lives in an underground
cavern, consisting of 20 smaller 
caves, all connected to 3 other
caves. There are other hazards,
such as bottomless pits and super
bats. You will get a message when
you are near the Wumpus, and you
have the option to shoot an arrow
into one of the adjacent rooms.
Hitting the Wumpus will kill it
and end the game. If you miss, there
is a chance the Wumpus will wake and
move to a different room, possibly
killing you. If run out of
time or arrows, you will die and
fail your mission.
